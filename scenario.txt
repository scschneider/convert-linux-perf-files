Title: Convert Performance Files
Actor: System

Scenario: 
1. System reads timezone OUT file to set the appropriate timezone for the metrics.
1. System reads configuration file and gets which OUT files to convert and what PIDs to filter on.
2. System reads OUT files and gets meaningful data based on the OUT file type
	Extension:
		a. Type1 is block format with each block containing it's own single date/time (timestamp). Each block contains header.
			When OUT file is Type1, the system will read the first header only. The system will read each block's timestamp and metrics.
		b. Type2 is block format with each line in the block containg time. Date is specified once on line 0. Each block contains header.
			When OUT file is Type2, the system will read the date on line 0. System will read the first header only. System will read each line's time and metrics.
		c. Type3 is list format with each line containing time. Date is specified once on line 0. Single instance of header
			When OUT file is Type3, the system will read the date on line 0. System will read the header. System will read each line's time and metrics
		d. Type4 is block format is block format with each line containing a timestamp in EPOCH format.
			When OUT file is Type4, the system will read the first header only. System will read each line's time and metrics.
3. System converts meaningful data to TSV files by reading the input from the OUT file conversion
4. System saves converted meaningful data to TSV files.
